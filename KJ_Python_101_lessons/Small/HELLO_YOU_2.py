#2. HELLO YOU!
#Same as the first exercise, but this time print the user's name in ALL CAPS, and also tell them the number of letters in their name.
#(Hint: You'll want to search for documentation on how to uppercase a string.)
name = input('WHAT IS YOUR NAME? ')
print('HELLO, ' + str(name.upper()) + '!')
print('YOUR NAME HAS ' + str(len(name)) + ' LETTERS IN IT! AWESOME!')
#solved
